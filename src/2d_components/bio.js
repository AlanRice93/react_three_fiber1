                Casey Berman is a creative technologist, developer and musician living in Brooklyn, New York.
				Casey currently works at Elephant, a creative company, as a senior Creative Technologist and front-end developer.
				Working almost exclusively on the Comcast account, Casey has helped push Xfinity's in-store experience into the 
				21st century using VR, AR and 3D web technologies for over two and a half years. Much of the R&D and prototyping Casey does lays the groundwork
				for in-store experiences, whether these be for the premiere and flagship stores or nationwide. In his spare time, Casey
				twiddles knobs on his army of analog synthesizers, breaks things in TouchDesigner, and
				spends time with his sphynx cat, Phoebe.
