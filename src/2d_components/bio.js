				Casey currently works at Elephant, a creative company, as a senior Creative Technologist and front-end developer.
				Working almost exclusively on the Comcast account, Casey has helped push Xfinity's in-store experience into the 
				21st century using VR, AR and 3D web technologies for over two and a half years. Much of the R&D and prototyping Casey does lays the groundwork

				twiddles knobs on his army of analog synthesizers, breaks things in TouchDesigner, and
				spends time with his sphynx cat, Phoebe.
